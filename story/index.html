                        <p id='fullStory1' class='fullStory'>Despite years of self-taught tinkering and my formal studies, I still didn't feel someone like me could be a 'real' programmer. I'd never met one, for starters, and in my mind, they sat in terribly fancy places hundreds of miles away doing terribly complicated things. </p>
                        <p id='fullStory2' class='fullStory'>After school I spent some years focusing on my studies and HR career. When I surfaced for air, I found that the dev world had changed beyond recognition: languages I knew were obsolete; smartphones, apps, web 2.0 and the cloud had arrived. When I tried to revive my skills, I felt overwhelmed.</p>
                        <p id='fullStory3' class='fullStory'>I finally began a full stack course in 2021 and have fallen in love again with the challenge of problem-solving. I'm 50% of the way through my course, have completed the front-end section, and will now be moving onto the back-end section. I know I have lots more to learn, but I'm excited to keep going this time.</p>
