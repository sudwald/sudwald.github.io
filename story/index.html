                    <p id='fullStory1' class='fullStory'>Despite years of self-taught tinkering, and performing well in my Computer Science A Level, I still didn't feel someone like me could be a 'real' programmer. I'd never met one, for starters, and in my mind, they sat in terribly fancy places hundreds of miles away doing terribly complicated things. </p>
                    <p id='fullStory2' class='fullStory'>After school I spent some years focusing on my studies and establishing a career in HR. By the time I surfaced for air, I found that the dev world had changed drastically. Languages I knew were obsolete; smartphones, apps, web 2.0 and the cloud had arrived; and when I tried to revive my web skills, I was overwhelmed by the frameworks, libraries and other new jargon I encountered. Toto, we weren't in Geocities anymore.</p>
                    <p id='fullStory3' class='fullStory'>I finally took the plunge on a full stack course in 2020 (yes, I'm a pandemic plunger) and have once more fallen in love. Now demystified, the possibilities offered by all the new frameworks, libraries, languages, APIs, and other resources have begun to amaze rather than terrify me. I can't wait to keep learning and keep coding!</p>
